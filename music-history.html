<h3>Just for fun...here's my favourite piece:</h3>

<p>
    It's really pretty difficult to choose a favourite piece of music. I tend to agree with music from the baroque period a lot; I love the music of Bach and Vivaldi. Ultimately, I love music that is complex and technical, but not for it's own sake. I don't enjoy music that has had to trade in it's emotive character and depth of feeling in order to reach the heights of technicality. I love it when these aspects of music find some mutality and balance.

<p>Here's just one piece that I find to be dramatic and quite beautiful: <strong>"Horizon of Memories"</strong>:
